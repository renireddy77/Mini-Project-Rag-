# How Streamlit Works

Streamlit is a Python library to build web apps for machine learning and data science.

# How it Works:

1. You write Python code with `st.title()`, `st.text_area()`, etc.
2. Streamlit runs a local web server.
3. The script **re-runs from top to bottom** on every user interaction.
4. Output is shown instantly in the browser.

We used Streamlit to create a form where the user enters symptoms. On clicking a button, the AI generates advice.
